# TF2-Simple-FOV
I am NOT original creator of this plugin. I just stripped fov code from [TF2-ClassicMovement Github](https://github.com/mphe/TF2-ClassicMovement), so I would have a functioning, simple fov plugin for my game-servers. If you need just a simple fov, feel free to use this.

# Convars
```c
    classicmovement_version - Just prints plugins version in console
    fov_min "90"            - The minimum value, allowed for players to set to
    fov_max "170"           - The maximum value, allowed for players to set to
```

# Commands
```c
    !fov    - In the chat
    sm_fov  - In the console
```
